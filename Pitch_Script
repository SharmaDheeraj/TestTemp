*Slides: 1 (Title)*

---

### SCRIPT - Opening

[GREETING]

"Good morning/afternoon, everyone. Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedules to be here today. I'm truly excited to share an initiative that I believe can transform how we present SARD to the world.

[PAUSE - Make eye contact with several people]

Before I start, I want to set the stage. About six months ago, as we were working on our PlayStation console projects and helping a fresher get up to speed with C#, we stumbled upon something interesting—a gap that I think affects all of us in this room.

[LEAN FORWARD - Show genuine concern]

Every time a potential new client visited, or when corporate headquarters asked about our capabilities, we found ourselves scrambling to put together presentations from scratch. Project information was scattered across different systems. Our achievements weren't visible in one place. And frankly, we weren't showcasing SARD as the center of excellence that we actually are."

---

### SPEAKER NOTES - Opening

- **Tone:** Warm, genuine, conversational
- **Body Language:** Stand at center, relaxed posture
- **Eye Contact:** Brief connection with 3-4 people around the room
- **Pace:** Slow and deliberate—no rushing
- **Key Emotion:** Show empathy for the problem

---

## SECTION 1: THE PROBLEM (2 minutes)
*Slides: 2-3*

---

### SCRIPT - The Problem

[TRANSITION]

"Now, here's what I learned from that experience, and I think you'll relate to this...

[CLICK TO SLIDE 2]

When we needed to showcase who we are—our capabilities, our expertise, our growth—we didn't have a single source of truth. We had:

- Project information scattered across multiple project management tools
- Team capabilities hidden in various HR systems
- Our achievements not documented in one accessible place
- No way to quickly answer: 'What exactly does SARD do? What have you built? Who are your experts?'

[PAUSE for 2 seconds]

But more importantly—

[EMPHASIS]

When a client or Sony headquarters wanted to understand SARD's value, we couldn't show them quickly. We couldn't show them confidently. And we certainly couldn't show them strategically.

[CLICK TO SLIDE 3]

So I asked myself: What if there was ONE place—a professional, comprehensive hub—where any stakeholder, any client, any Sony group could understand exactly what SARD is capable of? What if we didn't have to recreate the wheel every single time?"

---

### SPEAKER NOTES - The Problem

- **Tone:** Identify the pain point—make it relatable
- **Delivery:** Slightly faster, with emphasis on frustration
- **Gesture:** Use hand gestures to indicate "scattered" or "multiple places"
- **Pause:** Key strategic pause before "But more importantly"
- **Connection:** Look directly at audience to ensure understanding

---

## SECTION 2: THE INITIAL IDEA (2 minutes)
*Slide: 4*

---

### SCRIPT - The Initial Idea

[TRANSITION - Positive shift in tone]

"That question led us to develop a proof of concept—an internal dashboard for our PS4 projects. Nothing fancy. Just a way to:

- Consolidate all project and team data in one place
- Automatically pull metrics from Git for real-time insights
- Generate weekly and monthly reports without manual effort
- Give quick capability snapshots for client visits

[CLICK TO SLIDE 4]

The internal team loved it. But then something interesting happened...

[PAUSE]

Our immediate manager reviewed it and said: 'This is good. But I think you're thinking too small. What if we took this concept and transformed it into a strategic marketing tool for the entire SARD organization?'

[LEAN BACK - Show realization]

That's when the lightbulb came on. Instead of a reporting tool for PS4, why not create a comprehensive marketing platform that showcases SARD India as a CENTER OF EXCELLENCE across ALL our domains, ALL our devices, ALL our verticals?"

---

### SPEAKER NOTES - The Initial Idea

- **Tone Shift:** Move from problem-focused to solution-focused
- **Energy:** Increase energy level—show excitement
- **Delivery:** Build momentum with "Then something interesting happened"
- **Voice:** Use vocal emphasis on "CENTER OF EXCELLENCE"
- **Pace:** Vary pace—slower for emphasis, faster for excitement

---

## SECTION 3: THE EVOLUTION (2 minutes)
*Slide: 5*

---

### SCRIPT - The Evolution

"So we pivoted.

[CLICK TO SLIDE 5]

We took our initial internal tool concept and evolved it into something far more strategic and impactful.

Let me show you the evolution:

**PHASE 1 - The Initial Idea:**
- Scope: PS4 console projects only
- Audience: Internal teams
- Goal: Project visibility and reporting

**PHASE 2 - The Evolved Vision (Where We Are Now):**
- Scope: ALL of SARD—every vertical, every domain, every capability
- Audience: Sony group leaders, HQ, clients, talent market
- Goal: Strategic positioning of SARD as a trusted center of excellence

[PAUSE]

Think about what this means:

[EMPHASIS]

We're not just creating a reporting tool. We're creating SARD's strategic brand asset—a single, professional platform that tells our story comprehensively to the world.

When SIE needs to discuss outsourcing opportunities, we show this. When headquarters wants to understand SARD's capacity, we show this. When a new client evaluates us, we show this. When we're recruiting top talent, we use this.

[LEAN FORWARD]

It becomes our single source of truth for who SARD is and what we can deliver."

---

### SPEAKER NOTES - The Evolution

- **Visualization:** Use your hands to show growth/expansion
- **Pacing:** Slow down for the comparison
- **Emphasis:** Bold on "strategic brand asset"
- **Connection:** This is the "aha" moment—make sure audience gets it
- **Confidence:** Speak with conviction about this new direction

---

## SECTION 4: CURRENT GOAL (1.5 minutes)
*Slide: 6*

---

### SCRIPT - Current Goal

[CLICK TO SLIDE 6]

"So, here's where we are today. We want to build a professional marketing webpage for SARD India that positions us as a CENTER OF EXCELLENCE.

[PAUSE]

This platform will be THE go-to resource for:

- **Sony Leadership & Headquarters:** Clear visibility into what we can do and our capacity
- **Potential Clients & Business Partners:** Comprehensive proof of our expertise
- **Existing Sony Verticals:** Easy access to understand where SARD can add value
- **Talent Market:** Show why SARD is an amazing place to work

[GESTURE - Show expansiveness]

Imagine: Your vertical head gets a call from headquarters asking about outsourcing opportunities. Instead of scrambling to put together a presentation, you simply share a link. They get everything they need—our journey, our capabilities, our track record, our team expertise.

[VOICE - Conversational]

That's the vision."

---

### SPEAKER NOTES - Current Goal

- **Tone:** Paint the picture—make it tangible
- **Delivery:** Conversational, almost chatty
- **Pacing:** Medium pace with intentional pauses
- **Visual Cue:** Show the link sharing action (mime sending)
- **Emotion:** Convey relief and professionalism

---

## SECTION 5: VALUE PROPOSITION - FOR SARD (3 minutes)
*Slides: 7-8*

---

### SCRIPT - Value Proposition for SARD

[CLICK TO SLIDE 7]

"Now, let me be transparent. You might be thinking: 'Why should I care? What does this do for my vertical? What does this do for SARD as a whole?'

Fair questions. Let me answer them.

[PAUSE]

**For Business Development:**

We attract new projects. Right now, when Sony groups across India, Japan, or the US think about outsourcing, they might not think of SARD first. With this platform, we change that conversation. We demonstrate capability. We reduce the sales cycle. New business opportunities come to us, not us chasing them.

[EMPHASIS]

We're looking at a potential 25% increase in new project inquiries within the first 6 months.

**For Operational Efficiency:**

No more manual report creation. No more recreating presentations. No more siloed information. Everything lives in one place, continuously updated.

[GESTURE - Show consolidation]

That's 40+ hours per month saved across the organization—time we can reinvest into actual project delivery.

**For Employee Engagement:**

Your team members see themselves on this platform. They see their achievements celebrated. They see the career path. They see the growth story. That builds pride. That builds retention. That helps us attract better talent.

[VOICE - Warm]

When your engineer's master's degree is showcased, when their certification is recognized, when the project they poured their heart into is highlighted as a success story—that matters. It's not just about business. It's about our people.

**For Strategic Alignment:**

[CLICK TO SLIDE 8]

Sony headquarters and group companies understand SARD differently when they see this consolidated story. We're not just a vendor. We're a strategic partner. We're a center of excellence."

---

### SPEAKER NOTES - Value Proposition for SARD

- **Transparency:** Acknowledge their concern upfront—builds credibility
- **Breakdown:** Take each benefit separately—let it sink in
- **Numbers:** Use concrete metrics (25%, 40 hours)
- **Emotional Connection:** Shift to people focus—build empathy
- **Confidence:** End with conviction about strategic value

---

## SECTION 6: KEY PLATFORM SECTIONS (3 minutes)
*Slides: 9-10*

---

### SCRIPT - Key Platform Sections

"So what will be on this platform? Let me walk you through the sections.

[CLICK TO SLIDE 9]

**Section 1: Our Journey & Growth Story**

We tell SARD's story. Where we started in 2015, how we grew, what we've achieved. Growth metrics—not just headcount, but project growth, domain growth, device growth, quality growth. This gives context.

**Section 2: Technical Excellence**

We showcase our technical capabilities. Programming languages—Java, C#, Python, C++, and more. Cloud platforms. AI and machine learning expertise. Frontend, backend, middleware, security. This tells them: We can do the job.

**Section 3: Domain Excellence**

We're working across gaming, consumer electronics, imaging, audio, semiconductors, VR. For each domain, we show the evolution—what we've built, what we've learned, where we're excellent. This shows: We have deep expertise.

**Section 4: Device Excellence**

PlayStation Consoles, BRAVIA TVs, Alpha Cameras, Professional Lenses, PlayStation VR, Audio Products. For each, we show how many engineers we have dedicated, what they've delivered.

[CLICK TO SLIDE 10]

This tells them: We're diverse, capable, deep.

**Section 5: Vertical Details**

SIE, SSS, and other Sony business units. For each vertical, we show:
- How many engineers are working
- What projects are active
- What technology stack they're using
- What's been delivered

This makes it personal. It says: We understand your business.

**Section 6: Success Stories & Case Studies**

Real projects, real impact. 'We helped SIE reduce latency by 40%.' 'We helped BRAVIA team deliver 8K processing.' 'We reduced video encoding time by 50%.' 

Numbers. Results. Proof.

**Section 7: Our Capability Overview**

We have 450+ engineers. 85+ certifications across AWS, Azure, PMP. 45+ people with master's degrees. 98% project success rate. 4.8/5 client satisfaction.

This says: We're credible. We're professional. We get the job done.

**Section 8: Why Choose SARD**

Resource management, secure infrastructure, global timezone support, certified teams, agile methodology, proven processes.

[PAUSE]

This is our differentiator section. Why are we better than alternatives?

**Section 9: Connect With Us**

How do you start working with SARD? What's the process? What's the timeline? How do you get in touch?

[VOICE - Conclusive]

That's the complete platform. It tells a comprehensive, compelling story about who SARD is."

---

### SPEAKER NOTES - Key Platform Sections

- **Tone:** Instructive but engaging
- **Emphasis:** Use vocal emphasis on key metrics (450+, 98%, etc.)
- **Connection:** Make it relevant to their vertical—"This makes it personal"
- **Delivery:** Build momentum—each section builds on the previous

---

## SECTION 7: EXPECTED OUTCOMES (2 minutes)
*Slide: 11*

---

### SCRIPT - Expected Outcomes

[CLICK TO SLIDE 11]

"Let me paint a picture of what success looks like.

**In the Immediate Term (0-3 months):**

We get all of you on board. We understand your preferences, your data, your stories. We map out the architecture. We figure out where the data comes from.

**In the Short Term (3-6 months):**

The platform is live. It's professionally designed. It's populated with data. We can show it to anyone. We measure the impact.

**In the Long Term (6-12 months):**

We see measurable business results. More project inquiries. Better positioning with headquarters. Enhanced team morale. Demonstrated ROI.

[PAUSE - Look directly at audience]

But here's what's important right now: We need your participation. We need your data. We need your stories. Without you, this platform doesn't exist."

---

### SPEAKER NOTES - Expected Outcomes

- **Timeline:** Give them a clear picture of progression
- **Realism:** Be honest about the 12-month journey
- **Call to Involvement:** Subtly transition to what you need from them
- **Emphasis:** Make clear they're essential to success

---

## SECTION 8: DATA REQUIREMENTS (2.5 minutes)
*Slide: 12-13*

---

### SCRIPT - Data Requirements

[CLICK TO SLIDE 12]

"Now, let me be specific about what we need.

We need data in these areas:

- Project inventory—what are you working on?
- Team composition—who are your people?
- Technical skills—what are their capabilities?
- Git metrics—what's your velocity, your code quality?
- Certifications—who has AWS? Who's PMP certified?
- Case studies—what have you delivered that's worth showcasing?
- Domain expertise—where is your deepest knowledge?
- Device/technology information—what are you building?

[CLICK TO SLIDE 13]

Here's the beautiful part: You don't have to create new data. Much of this already exists.

- **HR Systems** have certification information
- **Project management tools** have project inventory
- **Git repositories** automatically capture metrics
- **Team leads** can articulate expertise areas
- **Project closures** generate case studies

[PAUSE]

We're not asking you to do extra work. We're asking you to help us collect and organize what you're already tracking.

[VOICE - Collaborative]

The work is distributed. Each vertical has a data steward. That steward spends maybe 10-15% of their time helping us organize and validate this information. It's not a huge lift."

---

### SPEAKER NOTES - Data Requirements

- **Tone:** Collaborative, not demanding
- **Reassurance:** Address the "extra work" concern immediately
- **Breakdown:** Make it less daunting by itemizing
- **Connection:** Show that you understand their constraints
- **Percentage:** Be specific about time commitment (10-15%)

---

## SECTION 9: DATA COLLECTION STRATEGY (2 minutes)
*Slide: 13*

---

### SCRIPT - Data Collection Strategy

"Here's how this works operationally:

**Automated Data:**
Git metrics flow automatically from your repositories. We set up API connections. Every week, every month, we have fresh data.

**Curated Data:**
Quarterly, your domain heads and team leads review and validate. 'Does this represent us accurately? Is this data current?' Small curate, big impact.

**Validated Data:**
We cross-check with HR systems. With resource management systems. Everything gets validated.

**Aggregated Data:**
All of this flows into the platform automatically. You don't have to push anything. It just happens.

[PAUSE]

The key stakeholders we'll work with:

- Directors and senior directors like yourselves—for guidance and sign-off
- Technical leads—for domain and technology expertise
- HR and L&D—for certification and capability data
- Project managers—for case studies and outcomes

[VOICE - Professional]

I'll be honest: We need about 30 minutes of your time for an interview. That's when we understand your preferences, your data sources, your stories. From there, the work is distributed."

---

### SPEAKER NOTES - Data Collection Strategy

- **Simplicity:** Make the process sound easy and structured
- **Transparency:** Be clear about who does what
- **Time Commitment:** Specific number (30 minutes) makes it manageable
- **Distributed Work:** Emphasize this is a team effort, not on one person

---

## SECTION 10: IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE (2 minutes)
*Slide: 14*

---

### SCRIPT - Implementation Timeline

[CLICK TO SLIDE 14]

"Let me give you a realistic timeline.

**Week 1-2: Stakeholder Alignment**
This is where you come in. We have these meetings. We understand your input. We get executive approval.

**Week 3-4: Platform Design & Setup**
Our development team—senior tech specialists and fresh engineers trained in C#—design the architecture. We create the interface. We set up the environment.

**Week 5-8: Data Integration**
We set up automated pipelines for Git metrics. We start curating and validating manual data. We run tests. We make sure everything's accurate.

**Week 9-12: Launch & Optimization**
We deploy the platform. We train the data stewards. We monitor performance. We optimize based on feedback.

[PAUSE]

So, timeline: 12 weeks. About 3 months from today to a live, functioning platform.

[VOICE - Realistic]

Is that fast? Yes. Is it ambitious? Yes. Is it doable? Absolutely, with your support."

---

### SPEAKER NOTES - Implementation Timeline

- **Clarity:** Each phase should be crystal clear

*Slide: 17*

---

### SCRIPT - Call to Action

[CLICK TO SLIDE 17]

"So, here's where we go from here.

**Immediate Actions (This Week):**

I need 30 minutes of each of your calendars. Just a 1-on-1 interview. We'll discuss:
- Your preferences for presenting your vertical to the rest of Sony
- Where your key data sources are
- What stories you'd like to highlight
- Any concerns or questions you have

[LEAN FORWARD - Make this personal]

I'm going to send you a calendar invite with some time slots. Please grab one that works.

**Follow-up (This Month):**

After our interviews, I'll consolidate everything. I'll present findings to our immediate managers. I'll get formal approval. Then we'll kick off development.

**The Ask:**

I'm asking for your partnership. This only works if you're engaged. If you see value. If you're willing to share data and stories.

[VOICE - Warm, direct]

I genuinely believe this platform will transform how SARD is perceived both internally and externally. I believe it will open doors. I believe it will make your teams proud. And I believe it will give us a competitive advantage in the Sony ecosystem.

[PAUSE]

But I can't do it alone. I need your voice. I need your data. I need your support."

---

### SPEAKER NOTES - Call to Action

- **Action Oriented:** Give them specific next steps
- **Personal:** Make the ask feel collaborative, not demanding
- **Emotion:** Build genuine enthusiasm
- **Clarity:** Be absolutely clear about what you need
- **Conviction:** Speak with true belief in the value

---

## SECTION 14: Q&A PREPARATION (Varies)
*Slide: 18*

---

### SCRIPT - Q&A Session

"Now, let me open it up for questions. I'm sure you have some, and I want to address them.

[PAUSE - Create space for questions]

What's on your mind?"

---

### ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

**Q1: "This sounds nice, but do we really have time for this? We're already stretched."**

*Answer:*
"Great question. The time commitment for each vertical is 10-15% for one person—a data steward. That's less than 2 weeks of full-time work spread over 12 weeks. Most of the heavy lifting is on our development team. The payoff is 40+ hours per month saved across the organization once it's live. So the ROI is positive."

---

**Q2: "What if the data isn't clean or complete?"**

*Answer:*
"Realistic concern. That's why we have a validation phase. We know data isn't perfect. We'll work with you to clean it, validate it, and make sure what goes on the platform represents your vertical accurately. Quality over speed. We'll get it right."

---

**Q3: "How is this different from other internal portals or wikis we've tried?"**

*Answer:*
"The difference is in the purpose and design. This isn't an internal knowledge base. This is a professional, external-facing marketing asset. It's designed to tell your story to leadership, clients, and the market. It's actively maintained, automatically updated with Git metrics, and designed with the end user in mind. It's not a place where information goes to die—it's a living, breathing representation of SARD."

---

**Q4: "Who owns this once it's built? Who maintains it?"**

*Answer:*
"Excellent question. There's shared ownership. Each vertical has a data steward who updates their section. Automated data (Git metrics) updates continuously. I oversee the overall platform as the product owner. We have a quarterly review cycle where each vertical lead validates their data. It's distributed ownership with centralized coordination."

---

**Q5: "Will this really lead to more business?"**

*Answer:*
"I can't guarantee it. But I can tell you: Right now, when Sony groups or clients want to understand SARD, we scramble to show them. With this platform, we show them confidently and comprehensively. That increases the probability of opportunity. Combined with good business development practices, yes, I believe we'll see measurable uptick in inquiries."

---

**Q6: "What's the budget for this?"**

*Answer:*
"We're using internal resources—our engineers and designers. No external hiring needed. The infrastructure costs are standard web hosting, which Sony's IT can provide. We're looking at minimal incremental cost. It's leveraging what we already have."

---

**Q7: "How long will it take to see ROI?"**

*Answer:*
"Operational savings start immediately once it's live—fewer hours spent on manual reporting. Business impact (new inquiries) could be 2-3 months of visibility before patterns emerge. Full ROI with demonstrated new revenue, 6-12 months. This is a strategic investment with a realistic return timeline."

---

**Q8: "Will our sensitive project information be exposed?"**

*Answer:*
"Great security question. We'll have access controls. Sensitive technical details stay internal. What's public is: high-level project portfolio, technology stacks, team sizes, general capabilities. No source code, no client contracts, no confidential details. It's marketing, not an information dump."

---

**Q9: "Can we see a prototype?"**

*Answer:*
"Absolutely. I have an interactive wireframe I can show you right now. [Show the HTML prototype on screen]. This is the structure and flow. Obviously the final design will be more polished, but this gives you the idea of what we're building. We can iterate on this based on your feedback."

---

### SPEAKER NOTES - Q&A

- **Listen Actively:** Let people finish their questions
- **Acknowledge:** Even if you disagree, acknowledge their concern
- **Direct Answers:** Don't waffle or over-explain
- **Confidence:** Even if you don't have a perfect answer, be honest and confident
- **Bridge Back:** After answering, try to bridge back to the value proposition
- **Note Taking:** Write down questions you can't answer—follow up later

---

## SECTION 15: CLOSING REMARKS (1.5 minutes)
*Slide: 19*

---

### SCRIPT - Closing

"Alright, let me wrap up.

Here's what I want you to walk away thinking:

[EMPHASIS - One point at a time]

**One:** SARD is world-class. We have the capability, the expertise, the track record. The world needs to know that.

**Two:** Right now, that story is scattered and disconnected. We have an opportunity to fix that.

**Three:** This platform is the fix. It's our strategic brand asset.

**Four:** It benefits all of us—more business, more efficient operations, happier employees, better strategic positioning.

**Five:** It only works with your participation.

[PAUSE]

I'm asking for your partnership. For 30 minutes of your time this week. For your data and stories. For your support.

[VOICE - Warm, genuine]

I genuinely believe we can build something that makes SARD proud. Something that opens doors. Something that positions us as the center of excellence we truly are.

[FINAL PAUSE]

Thank you for your time today. Let's make this happen together."

---

### SPEAKER NOTES - Closing

- **Recap:** Hit the five key points quickly
- **Emotion:** Build from logic to emotion
- **Call to Action:** Make the ask one more time
- **Warmth:** End on a human note
- **Silence:** Let the closing land—don't rush to leave

## DELIVERY TIPS

### General Presentation Skills

1. **Pacing:** Vary your pace. Slow for emphasis, faster for excitement, measured for facts.

2. **Pauses:** Embrace silence. A 2-3 second pause lets your point land. It makes you look thoughtful, not nervous.

3. **Eye Contact:** Look at different people throughout. Brief, genuine connection with 3-4 people each minute.

4. **Body Language:**
   - Stand at center stage
   - Relax your shoulders
   - Use hand gestures to emphasize points
   - Lean slightly forward when making important asks
   - Lean back when transitioning between sections

5. **Voice:**
   - Speak clearly and deliberately
   - Use vocal emphasis on key words and numbers
   - Lower your voice slightly for serious points
   - Raise your voice slightly for enthusiasm
   - Never apologize for needing attention

6. **Energy:** Match your energy to your message. Urgent problem = higher energy. Strategic thinking = measured energy. Call to action = confident energy.

### Slide Management

- **Advance Smoothly:** Don't click too quickly between slides
- **Read the Room:** If people look confused, slow down and explain
- **Use Notes:** Refer to your notes, but don't read verbatim
- **Build Anticipation:** Sometimes you can tease the next section before you click

### Handling Different Audiences

**For Directors (Strategic Mindset):**
- Emphasize business impact
- Lead with ROI
- Be concise—they value time
- Speak their language (metrics, strategy, competitive advantage)

**For Senior Directors (Implementation Mindset):**
- Show you've thought through details
- Be realistic about timelines and resources
- Demonstrate you have a plan
- Ask for their specific inputs

**For Technical Leads:**
- Show you understand technical complexity
- Be honest about technology choices
- Invite their technical input
- Demonstrate you've considered scalability

### Dealing with Difficult Moments

**If You Blank on a Point:**
"Let me gather my thoughts for a second. [Pause]. What I mean is..."

**If Someone Challenges You:**
"That's a really good point. I hadn't thought about it that way. Let me think through that and get back to you."

**If The Room Feels Skeptical:**
"I can see the hesitation, and that's fair. Let me try to address that concern differently..."

**If You're Running Long:**
"I see we're running over. Let me quickly hit the key points and then we can go deeper in follow-up conversations."
